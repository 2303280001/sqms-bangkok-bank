# CMMI Process Maturity Analysis

## 4.1 CMMI Overview
CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is a framework used to assess
and improve the maturity and capability of software development and
quality management processes.

Higher maturity levels indicate more predictable, controlled,
and continuously improving processes.

## 4.2 Current Maturity Assessment

**Assessed Maturity Level: CMMI Level 2 – Managed**

### Justification:
- Project planning activities are performed.
- Defects are identified and tracked using GitHub Issues.
- Basic quality assurance and testing activities exist.
- Risks are identified and documented.
- Processes are applied at the project level but are not fully standardized across the organization.

The organization demonstrates managed processes, but lacks
organization-wide standardization and quantitative quality metrics.

## 4.3 Process Improvement Plan (Transition to Level 3 – Defined)

To move from Level 2 to Level 3, the following improvements are proposed:

1. **Process Standardization**
   - Define and document standard QA and testing procedures.
   - Apply consistent workflows across all projects.

2. **Formal Quality Reviews**
   - Introduce mandatory code reviews and quality audits.
   - Perform regular defect trend analysis.

3. **Measurement and Monitoring**
   - Track quality metrics such as defect density and test coverage.
   - Use metrics to support decision-making and continuous improvement.
